------------------

Builds a game of battling alien spaceships using Javascript.
Earth has been attacked by a horde of aliens! You are the captain of the USS HelloWorld (ussEnter4Prize), on a mission to destroy every last alien ship.

Battle the aliens as you try to destroy them with your lasers.

There are six alien ships. The aliens' weakness is that they are too logical and attack one at a time: they will wait to see the outcome
of a battle before deploying another alien ship. Your strength is that you have the initiative and get to attack first. However, you do 
not have targeting lasers and can only attack the aliens in order. After you have destroyed a ship, you have the option to make a hasty retreat.

A game round would look like this:
  You attack the first alien ship
  If the ship survives, it attacks you
  If you survive, you attack the ship again
  If it survives, it attacks you again â€¦ etc
  If you destroy the ship, you have the option to attack the next ship or to retreat
  If you retreat, the game is over, perhaps leaving the game open for further developments or options
  You win the game if you destroy all of the aliens
  You lose the game if you are destroyed


Ship Properties
hull is the same as hitpoints. If hull reaches 0 or less, the ship is destroyed
firepower is the amount of damage done to the hull of the target with a successful hit
accuracy is the chance between 0 and 1 that the ship will hit its target
Your spaceship, the USS HelloWorld should have the following properties:

hull - 20
firepower - 5
accuracy - .7
The alien ships should each have the following ranged properties determined randomly:

hull - between 3 and 6
firepower - between 2 and 4
accuracy - between .6 and .8
You could be battling six alien ships each with unique values.
